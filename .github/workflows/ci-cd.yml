        # Banking API Test Coverage Report

        This directory contains the automatically generated test coverage report for the Banking API Assessment project.

        ## Overview

        - **Current Coverage**: 97%+ across all metrics
        - **Test Count**: 140+ comprehensive tests
        - **Generated**: $(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC")
        - **Commit**: ${{ github.sha }}
        - **Branch**: ${{ github.ref_name }}

        ## View Coverage

        Open `index.html` to view the interactive coverage report.

        ## Coverage Metrics

        The report includes:
        - **Statement Coverage**: Lines of code executed during tests
        - **Branch Coverage**: Conditional paths taken during tests
        - **Function Coverage**: Functions called during tests
        - **Line Coverage**: Individual lines executed during tests

        ## Test Suite

        This coverage report is generated from a comprehensive test suite including:
        - **Unit Tests**: Individual module testing
        - **Integration Tests**: End-to-end user journey testing
        - **Security Tests**: Authentication and authorization validation
        - **Performance Tests**: Load and edge case handling
