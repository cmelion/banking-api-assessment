# Remaining Tasks for Banking API Assessment

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Core Components
- **Authentication System**: Fully functional with JWT tokens, refresh tokens, and Argon2id password hashing
- **User Management**: Complete CRUD operations with authorization
- **Account Management**: All endpoints implemented with proper business logic
- **Money Transfers**: Atomic transfers with idempotency support and dual-entry bookkeeping
- **Transaction History**: Complete with filtering, pagination, and summaries
- **Card Management**: Mock implementation with PCI-compliant masking
- **Statement Generation**: Functional statement creation and retrieval
- **Database**: Prisma with SQLite, complete schema with all entities
- **Security**: JWT auth, secure password hashing, input validation, authorization
- **Infrastructure**: Docker setup, health checks, structured logging with Pino
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI available at `/docs`

## üî¥ Critical Missing Requirements

### 1. Test Suite (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [x] **Authentication Tests**: COMPLETE - Tests exist for signup, login endpoints
- [x] **User Management Tests**: COMPLETE - Tests exist for user profile endpoints
- [ ] **Account Tests**: No tests for account management endpoints
  - Create account, list accounts, get account details
  - Balance calculations and updates
- [ ] **Transfer Tests**: No tests for money transfer endpoints
  - Atomic operations, idempotency validation
  - Insufficient funds scenarios
  - Cross-account transfers
- [ ] **Transaction Tests**: No tests for transaction endpoints
  - Transaction history, filtering, pagination
  - Transaction summaries
- [ ] **Card Management Tests**: No tests for card endpoints
  - Card issuance, listing, updates
- [ ] **Statement Tests**: No tests for statement generation
  - Statement creation, retrieval
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: No coverage reporting configured
  - Target: 80%+ statement/branch coverage
  - Need to set up coverage tools and CI integration

### 2. Production Readiness Gaps
- [ ] **Graceful Shutdown**: Not implemented
  - Need SIGTERM handler
  - Connection draining
  - Proper cleanup procedures
- [ ] **Database Migrations**: Basic setup exists but needs verification
  - Migration strategy documentation
  - Rollback procedures
- [ ] **Environment Configuration**: Partial
  - .env.example exists but may need updates
  - Production configuration guidelines missing

## üìã Task Checklist

### Testing (Est. 8-10 hours)
1. **Set up test infrastructure**
   - Configure Vitest with proper settings
   - Set up test database isolation
   - Create test utilities and fixtures

2. **Write unit tests**
   - Auth module (signup, login, token refresh)
   - Account operations (creation, balance management)
   - Transfer logic (atomicity, idempotency, validation)
   - Transaction posting and balance calculations

3. **Write integration tests**
   - Complete auth flow (signup ‚Üí login ‚Üí authenticated requests)
   - Account lifecycle (create ‚Üí update ‚Üí transactions ‚Üí balance)
   - Transfer scenarios (successful, failed, idempotent)
   - Error cases (unauthorized, invalid data, insufficient funds)

4. **Configure coverage reporting**
   - Set up coverage tools
   - Add coverage scripts to package.json
   - Ensure 80%+ coverage target

### Documentation (Est. 2-3 hours)
1. **Update README.md**
   - Complete setup instructions
   - API endpoint documentation
   - Authentication flow explanation
   - Development and testing guides

2. **Create/Update SECURITY.md**
   - Password storage details
   - JWT implementation
   - PCI compliance approach
   - Known security considerations

3. **Create/Update ROADMAP.md**
   - Future enhancements
   - Performance optimizations
   - Advanced features

4. **Create AI_USAGE.md**
   - Document AI tools used
   - Key prompts and iterations
   - Manual interventions required
   - Lessons learned

### Infrastructure Verification (Est. 1-2 hours)
1. **Verify Docker setup**
   - Test multi-stage build
   - Verify alpine compatibility
   - Check non-root user configuration

2. **Test docker-compose**
   - Verify all services start correctly
   - Test environment variable injection
   - Verify volume mounting for SQLite

3. **Implement graceful shutdown**
   - Add SIGTERM handler
   - Implement connection draining
   - Test shutdown scenarios

## üéØ Priority Order

1. **CRITICAL**: Write test suite (unit + integration tests)
2. **CRITICAL**: Set up test coverage reporting
3. **HIGH**: Implement graceful shutdown
4. **HIGH**: Complete documentation (README, SECURITY, ROADMAP)
5. **MEDIUM**: Create AI usage report
6. **LOW**: Additional verification of Docker setup

## ‚è± Estimated Timeline

- **Testing Implementation**: 6-8 hours (auth and user tests already exist)
- **Documentation**: 2-3 hours
- **Infrastructure**: 1-2 hours
- **Total**: ~9-13 hours

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Start with test infrastructure setup
2. Write critical unit tests for financial operations
3. Add integration tests for complete user flows
4. Ensure test coverage meets 80% target
5. Complete all documentation
6. Final verification of containerization

## Notes

- The core banking functionality is **fully implemented** and appears production-ready
- The main gap is **test coverage** - this is critical for a banking application
- All other requirements are either met or have minor gaps that can be quickly addressed
- The codebase quality is excellent with proper error handling, validation, and security measures
