# Security Considerations

This document outlines the security features, considerations, and best practices implemented in the Banking API Assessment project.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Security**: Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes) with rotating refresh tokens (7 days)
- **Password Security**: Argon2id hashing with per-user salts for maximum security
- **Token Management**: Secure token storage and automatic refresh mechanisms
- **Role-Based Access**: User/admin roles for endpoint protection

### Input Validation & Data Protection

- **JSON Schema Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all API requests
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Prisma ORM provides automatic protection
- **XSS Protection**: Input sanitization and output encoding
- **CORS Configuration**: Controlled cross-origin resource sharing

### Financial Data Security

- **Money Precision**: Uses Prisma Decimal type to prevent floating-point errors
- **PCI Compliance**: No raw card data storage - only masked/tokenized values
- **Idempotency**: Prevents duplicate transactions using `Idempotency-Key` headers
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction logging with user context

### Infrastructure Security

- **Environment Secrets**: Never committed to repository, managed via environment variables
- **HTTPS Only**: Enforced in production environments
- **Secure Headers**: Security headers for protection against common attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DoS attacks

## üö® Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

- **Card Operations**: Currently mocked for assessment purposes
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Not implemented in current version
- **Advanced Fraud Detection**: Basic patterns only, would need enhancement for production
- **Rate Limiting**: Basic implementation, would need sophisticated rules for production

### Production Requirements

For a production banking system, additional security measures would be required:

1. **PCI DSS Compliance**: Full compliance for card data handling
2. **Advanced Fraud Detection**: Machine learning-based transaction monitoring
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: SMS, email, or app-based 2FA
4. **Hardware Security Modules**: For cryptographic key management
5. **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
6. **Compliance Auditing**: SOX, PCI DSS, and other regulatory requirements

## üîê Security Best Practices

### Development

- All sensitive data redacted from logs
- No secrets in source code or configuration files
- Secure coding practices with TypeScript strict mode
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning

### Deployment

- Container security scanning
- Secrets management via environment variables
- Network isolation and firewalls
- Regular security updates and patches

### Monitoring

- **Structured Logging**: Security events with correlation IDs
- **Authentication Monitoring**: Failed login attempts and suspicious activity
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Unusual patterns and potential fraud detection
- **Error Tracking**: Centralized error handling with security context

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Testing

The project includes comprehensive security testing:

- **Authentication Flow Testing**: Signup, login, token refresh, and logout
- **Authorization Testing**: Endpoint access control and user isolation
- **Input Validation Testing**: Malformed requests and edge cases
- **SQL Injection Testing**: Database query safety verification
